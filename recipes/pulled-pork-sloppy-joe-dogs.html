        Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onions until golden, then tip in the
        garlic powder and garlic cloves, and cook for a few minutes. Stir in the
        tomato purée, oregano and paprika, then pour in the chicken stock and
        bring to the boil. Add the pork and stir through any sauce that comes
        with it. Simmer for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins until reduced, adding the peppers
        and chilli 10 mins before the end. Take off the heat and shred the pork
        through the sauce, then stir through the mustard and set aside.
